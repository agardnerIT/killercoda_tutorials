## Reset System

Use this Ansible playbook to:

1) Uninstall Apache
2) Uninstall the existing host-based OneAgent
2) Install k3s (lightweight kubernetes)

```
ansible-playbook ~/playbooks/reset-system.yaml
```{{exec}}

## Verify Cluster

`kubectl get nodes`{{exec}} should now work.

## Install Kubernetes OneAgent

Use this script to install the Dynatrace Operator. The only modification made is to lower the resources request for this small demo environment:
```
ansible-playbook ~/playbooks/install-operator.yaml
```{{exec}}

## Validate Dynatrace Installation

1) Your cluster connection should show in Dynatrace
2) All pods should be running in `dynatrace` namespace

## Deploy Nginx

```
cd
cat << EOF > install_nginx.yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment

    app: nginx

kubectl apply -f ~/install_nginx.yaml
```{{exec}}

## Check Progress and Verify Deployment

Watch the output of `kubectl get pods`{{exec}} until the pods are Running.

Validate that Nginx is running on port 80 [here]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_80}})
