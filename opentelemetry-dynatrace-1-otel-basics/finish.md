# Summary

You have successfully generated OpenTelemetry data and sent it to Dynatrace.

Your applications will be instrumented by the developers. The key piece really is just that Collector `config.yaml`{{}} which tells the collector to send the traces to Dynatrace.

That's all there is to it!

Remember: If you have a OneAgent deployed, all of this happens magically for you.

Final Reminder: Please delete the API token now for security.
