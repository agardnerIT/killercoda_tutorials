# Summary

You have successfully created 2 SBOMs:

- 1x for a Dockerfile
- 1x for a built container image

You can now see that software "as defined" and "as built" mean different things and consequently their SBOMs are different.

You have audited both SBOMs and found the defects highlighted by Grype.
