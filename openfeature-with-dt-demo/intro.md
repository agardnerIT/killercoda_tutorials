# Welcome to OpenFeature

OpenFeature: Building an open standard for feature flags.

> Improve the software development lifecycle, no matter the size of the project, by standardizing feature flagging for everyone.

## While You Wait

OpenFeature is an open, vendor-neutral specification for feature flagging. It provides a standardised abstraction layer between your code and the underlying feature flag vendor. In this demo, you'll be introducted to the benefits of feature flags and how OpenFeature can be used to seemlessly switch between different vendors and tools.
