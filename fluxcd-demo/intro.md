# FluxCD

This tutorial follows the [getting started](https://fluxcd.io/flux/get-started/) guide but it is in your browser and so nothing to install on your cluster.

The terminal window on the right is a fully featured and interactive terminal window preconfigured with a kubernetes cluster.

## Try it
Try printing the namespaces:
```
kubectl get namespaces
```

## You Will Need
1. A GitHub account
2. To create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope
