### Problem Enrichment Demo

This hands on exercise will show how to enrich Dynatrace problems.

Imagine you have been asked to upgrade a system. Your colleague has told you to perform the following steps:


1. Install a Dynatrace OneAgent
2. Follow the provided instructions to run a production release
3. Check Dynatrace to ensure no issues with the release

Unknown to your colleague, the production release causes an issue and it is difficult to solve in Dynatrace as DT does not provide a root cause.

Later sections of this tutorial will show an improved release process.
