## Preparation

Create a DT API token with the following permissions:

1. `DataExport` (Access problem and event feed, metrics, and topology)
2. `WriteConfig` (Write configuration)

## Install OneAgent
Install a Dynatrace OneAgent and set the hostgroup to `at-demo-enrichment`.


## (optional) Forgotten to Set Host Group?
If you forgot to set the host group, run the following playbook:

```
ansible-playbook ~/playbooks/set-oneagent-host-group.yaml
```{{exec}}

## Create Auto Tag Rule

Create an auto-tag rule to tag this host with the host group:

```
ansible-playbook ~/playbooks/create-tag-rule.yaml
```{{exec}}

Click `Next` when you have verified the OneAgent is installed, connected to the SaaS tenant and correctly tagged.
