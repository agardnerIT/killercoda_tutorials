Imagine you are subscribed to an email mailing list. At the bottom of every email is an unsubscribe link.

It takes you to a page that provides a way to unsubscribe.

You notice that the URL has an `id` parameter. It looks like you are `id=3`

You wonder what happens if you use `id=2` instead.

This is parameter enumeration. You are easily able to adjust something and see data you aren't supposed to see.

It's not a stretch to imagine writing a script to run through every ID and retrieve the entire mailing list.
