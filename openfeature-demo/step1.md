# Welcome to OpenFeature

The demo system has now started. You can access the link and the tutorial below.

When you open the demo user interface, the box should appear and guide you through the tutorial.

OpenFeature is fully compatible with OpenTelemetry and the demo system emits trace data to Jaeger. Jaeger is available via these links:

- [➡️ Open the OpenFeature Demo]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_30000}})
- [➡️ Open Jaeger to see OpenTelemetry traces]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_16686}}).
