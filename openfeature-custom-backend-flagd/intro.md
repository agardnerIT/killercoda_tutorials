# OpenFeature and flagd Demonstration

This demonstration will show a GitOps-based system and approach for storing, changing and evaluating feature flags.

The demo will use [flagd](https://github.com/open-feature/flagd), an OpenFeature compliant feature flag daemon & API layer but these principles could be used with any open source or commercial feature flag vendor.


## The System
As you can see, things are being installed for you. When completed, the system will consist of:

- A local Git repo (using Gitea)
- `flagd`{{}} binary is downloaded
- `git`{{}} and `tea`{{}} binaries are available to interact with Git

## Be Patient...
Please wait until you see `ðŸŽ‰ Installation Complete ðŸŽ‰` then click `Start` to begin.
