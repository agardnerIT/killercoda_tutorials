## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
In this tutorial you have build an OpenFeature compliant feature flag backend using flagd.

You now have a pure GitOps feature flagging system. You can change only a JSON file and your application will automatically leverage the changes.

This is just the start. flagd is capable of a lot more, such as providing multiple flag sources, local file usage or retrieval over HTTPS, gRPC sync. Find out more at the links below.
