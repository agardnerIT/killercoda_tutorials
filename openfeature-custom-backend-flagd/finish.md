## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
In this tutorial you have build an OpenFeature compliant feature flag backend using flagd.

You now have a pure GitOps feature flagging system. You can change only a JSON file and your application will automatically leverage the changes.

This is just the start. flagd is capable of a lot more, such as providing multiple flag sources, local file usage or retrieval over HTTPS, gRPC sync. Find out more at the links below.

## What's Next?

In this tutorial, interaction with the flagd API was via `curl`{{}}. In reality, you wouldn't want your application becoming reliant on flagd - that's the entire premise of OpenFeature. Your application should be able to say "getAFlag" without caring about the backend system (flagd in this case).

To achieve this, OpenFeature offers [language specific flagd providers](https://github.com/open-feature/flagd/blob/main/docs/usage/flagd_providers.md) which interact and "translate" to flagd code for you.

Your application code then looks like this:

```
openfeature.SetProvider(flagd.NewProvider(
        flagd.WithHost("flagDHost"),
        flagd.WithPort(8013),
    ))

// Get an openFeature client
client := openfeature.NewClient("myApp")

// Get flag values
value, err := client.BooleanValue(
		context.Background(), "myFlagValue", false, openfeature.EvaluationContext{},
	)
```
