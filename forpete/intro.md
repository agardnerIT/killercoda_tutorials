# Five Minutes to Feature Flags

We're going to add feature flagging to a node service in under five minutes using OpenFeature, the open, vendor-agnostic feature flagging SDK.

We'll be working with a simple [express](https://expressjs.com/) server, but if you have any basic familiarity with JavaScript and node you should be able to follow along.

## Please Be Patient... 

As you can see on the right, we're busy installing everything you'll need.
