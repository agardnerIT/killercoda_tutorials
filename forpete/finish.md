## Congratulations

We can get started with feature flags with low investment and low risk, and once we're ready, it's just a few lines of code to transition to a full-featured, scalable backend.

## Next Steps

To learn more about OpenFeature, check out their documentation [here](https://docs.openfeature.dev). Specifically, you can read more about how the [evaluation API works](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-api), what [tech stacks are supported](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/), or read [more tutorials](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/category/getting-started) about using OpenFeature in a variety of tech stacks.

We strive to provide a welcoming, open community. If you have any questions - or just want to nerd out about feature flags - the [#OpenFeature](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0344AANLA1) channel in the CNCF slack is the place for you.

This tutorial was originally created as a blog post [Five Minutes to Feature Flags by Pete Hodgson](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2023/03/02/five-minutes-to-feature-flags/) and graciously donated to the OpenFeature project.
