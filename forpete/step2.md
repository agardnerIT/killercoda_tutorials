# Install OpenFeature SDK
```
npm install @openfeature/js-sdk
```{{exec}}

Run the OpenFeature instrumented app:

```
node ~/app/app4.js
```{{exec interrupt}}

But that's pretty pointless... Text explaining minimalist provider.

```
npm install @moredip/openfeature-minimalist-provider
node ~/app/app5.js
```{{exec interrupt}}
